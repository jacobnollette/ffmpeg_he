# ffmpeg-h265

Bunch of scripts for batching season folders recursively into h265.
Handy script for killing rogue processes, since ctrl-c doesn't work well with this deep of a loop.

#### Schemes
* 480 - 100%
* 720 - 150%
* 1280 - 266.6%
* 1920 - 400%

#### Notes

* 0720_medium @575k - basically comperable to h264
