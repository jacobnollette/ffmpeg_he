# ffmpeg-h265

This script has come a long way... And it's much dryier then past iterations. Now it's basically one file for video. Audio coming soon.

##	Flags
Really the only required flag is -f
Flags and defaults below

*	-s (true / false) - defaults true
* -i (image width) - defaults to autosize to current size
* -q (quality, low, medium, high) - defaults to low, which is pretty good IMO. 256k or greater audio quality.
* -f (pass it a file path) - must be absolute path
